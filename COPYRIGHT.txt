This directory contains 'Beebem' a program which attempts to emulate
the behavior of the British Broadcasting Corporation Model B computer system
produced in the early 1980's by Acorn Computers Ltd of Cambridge, England.
It should be noted at this stage that the author has no connection with
either the BBC or Acorn and this product has not been approved or
sanctioned by either of them.  The author recognizes all trademarks etc.
I don't want to tread on anyones toes - if there is something else I should
say then tell me - I'll add it.

The copyright for Beebem is held by David Alan Gilbert and the other authors
and contributors.
