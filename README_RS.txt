BeebWin 0.04 patched by Robert Schmidt
-------------------------------------

For the original BeebEm/BeebWin distributions (by David Gilbert and
Nigel Magnay), go to ftp://ftp.compsoc.man.ac.uk/pub/beebem.

NOTE: If you're unexperienced with BeebWin, you'll probably need and
appreciate the documentation included there!

RBEEBWIN.EXE has been patched and recompiled (by me) with the following
changes from the original BeebWin version 0.4:

1. Correct aspect ratio in modes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7.  In doing this,
   modes 0 and 3, as well as modes with custom widths, do not work
   correctly.
2. working backspace key
3. A decent looking mode 7 font.
4. Skip every second frame (for extra speed).
5. Compiled with full optimizations for speed

RBEEBWIN.EXE requires WinG (version 1.0), which can be fetched from
Microsoft's sites on the net, as well as from many others.


Bye,
